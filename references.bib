	abstract = {A fundamental problem for electronic commerce is the buying and selling of digital goods between individuals that may not know or trust each other. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by the use of trusted third-parties such as credit-card companies, mediated escrows, legal adjudication, or reputation systems. Despite the rise of blockchain protocols as a way to send payments without trusted third parties, the important problem of exchanging a digital good for payment without trusted third parties has been paid much less attention. We refer to this problem as the Buyer and Seller’s Dilemma and present for it a dual-deposit escrow trade protocol which uses double-sided payment deposits in conjunction with simple cryptographic primitives, and that can be implemented using a blockchain-based smart contract. We analyze our protocol as an extensive-form game and prove that the Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium for this game is for both the buyer and seller to cooperate and behave honestly. We address this problem under the assumption that the digital good being traded is known and veriﬁable, with a ﬁxed price known to both parties.},

	abstract = {Crypto-currency is a form of decentralized digital currency that has changed the world of ﬁnance over the past several years. Bitcoin[6] lacks a central authority and protects anonymity, while allowing a relatively low-cost alternative to ﬁat. It opens the doors for international exchange of commodities and has the potential to change how business is conducted. The signature and scripting system that Bitcoin uses allows for the creation of smart contracts. Also using signatures, it is possible to create accounts that require multiple signatures (multisig accounts) as well as transactions with multiple inputs and outputs. There has been discussion of some of the current weaknesses with smart contracts. We address these weaknesses to make smart contracts immediately accessible on the Bitcoin network. As proposed, this protocol offers a system of commitment schemes and business protocols that greatly reduces the issues of extortion and malleability from two-party escrow.},

	abstract = {Unlike the normal transactions in blockchain, transactions made for property exchange are different because buyer or seller do not want to reveal any information to anyone and also, they are not ready to transfer either the property or money before other person transfers. This results in a dilemma who should transfer first. In order to eliminate this dilemma, escrow systems were introduced. One of the major problems with the escrow system is that the mediator can act maliciously and transfer whole funds to his/her account. This paper focuses on introducing a cheat proof escrow system. An algorithm is proposed which provides security and privacy and also guarantees unbiased service to buyer as well as seller along with a cheat proof escrow.},

There is an inherent circular dependency: should be the buyer trust the seller and pay before receiving the goods or should the seller trust the buyer and ship the goods before receiving payment? This dilemma is addressed in practice using a third party escrow service. However, we show that naive escrow protocols introduce both privacy and security issues. We formalize the escrow problem and present a suite of schemes with improved security and privacy properties. Our schemes are compatible with Bitcoin and similar blockchain-based cryptocurrencies.},

	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

 abstract = {This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press publishedTheory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in theNew York Times, ttheAmerican Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},
