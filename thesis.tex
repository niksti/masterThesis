\subsection{Turn-based games}
\begin{definition}[turn-based games]
\label{def:turn-based-game}
A game is turn-based if only one party can play at a time and its move is revealed
to all other parties before the next move.
\end{definition}
To analyse turn-based games we will use game trees.\newline

\orfnote{Game trees and
examples should be introduced in the preliminaries. Mention that, in our work, a
game is turn-based if only one party can play at a time and its move is revealed
to all other parties before the next move. Mention that we can combine
simultaneous and turn-based games if some moves are turn-based and some are
simultaneous.}


\orfnote{for the example, prefer parties $A$, $B$ instead
of $B$, $S$. For actions, you can e.g. use $L$, $R$, which is common in Game
Theory literature for generic moves when every choice is binary. Do not use the
same payouts everywhere. Better use specific numbers. Use numbers with a single
Nash Equilibrium and walk the reader through the analysis of why it is a Nash
Equilibrium.}

\orfnote{use $B$, $S$ instead of $B$, $S$ in the tikzpicture as well.}

To find the Nash Equilibrium of this game we will use the method "iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies".

\subsection{Simultaneous games}
\begin{definition}[Simultaneous games]
\label{def:simultaneous-game}
A game is simultaneous, if at least two parties play at a time. 
\end{definition}

To analyse simultaneous games we will use a table.
\orfnote{My favorite table format mentions the two parties' names at the
top-left cell with a diagonal, as in the link:
\url{https://www.jasss.org/12/4/7/Ohdaira-Table-01.jpg}. Each party has a color
(e.g.\ $S$ blue, $B$ red). The actions can be full words; in the example use "be
honest"/"lie" for one player and "report"/"hide" for the other, highlighting
that the players need not be symmetric. The payouts are specific numbers,
each colored with the respective player's color.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c||c|c| }
& $Pay$ & $Withhold$  \\
\hline
\hline
$Send$ & $P_S | P_B$ & $P_S | P_B$ \\
\hline
$Keep$ & $P_S | P_B$ & $P_S | P_B$ \\ 
\hline
\label{tab:example-table}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\captionof{table}{Example table}

\minisec{Description} On the top are the possible strategies for the buyer: $Pay$ is the strategy where the buyer behaves honestly and $Withhold$ is the strategy where the Buyer behaves dishonestly.\newline
On the left side are the strategies for the seller. Similar to the buyer, $Send$ denotes the strategy where the seller behaves honestly and $Keep$ denotes the strategy where the seller behaves dishonestly.\newline

For each combination of strategies the two parties get a specific payout. $P_S$ denotes the payout of the seller and $P_B$ denotes the payout of the buyer.
\orfnote{Once again, in the examples (which will move to the Preliminaries)
don't mention Seller/Buyer. Also I believe it will be confusing to mention
honesty/dishonesty in the rationality-based games. In general for our games,
prefer to use more specific terms for the actions and not use cryptographic
(honest/dishonest) terms. More discussion below.}

\begin{definition}[Utility Function]
\label{def:utility-function}
The utility function $U_P(G)$ describes how much utility a physical good $G$ provides to a player $P$. The output of this function is a numerical value, which corresponds to the amount of coins that have equal value as $U_P(G)$. In this work, utility will always be a positive integer.
\end{definition}

\section{Entities}

\begin{definition}[Seller]
\label{def:seller}
A rational entity $S$ that owns a specific physical good $G$. The seller
has bigger utility in owning $P$ amount of coins in contrast to owning $G$ (c.f.\ref{eq:seller-utility}) He therefore desires to exchange $G$ against coins of amount $P$.
\end{definition}

%Insert Utility function distribution
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:seller-utility}
    U_S(G) + P > P > U_S(G) > 0
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}[Buyer]
\label{def:buyer}
A rational entity $B$ that owns at least $P$ coins. The Buyer has greater utility in owning $G$ in contrast to  owning $P$ amount of coins (c.f. \ref{eq:buyer-utility}). He therefore desires to exchange coins of amount $P$ against $G$.
\end{definition}

%Insert Utility function distribution
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:buyer-utility}
    U_B(G) + P > U_B(G) > P > 0
\end{equation}

\orfnote{The SC is not really an escrow, as it doesn't hold on to the physical
good, only the money}

\section{The Game}
\label{sec:the-game}
\orfnote{I don't like \textbackslash{}minisec in general. It does not have a
number so you cannot refer to it. It feels like a compromise between a new
section and continuous prose. It is used in a way that turns the whole thesis
into a list of short minisecs, almost like a bullet-point list. In order to look
good and read like a story, it should be formatted into prose with correct
paragraph breaks.}

\begin{definition}[Initial State]
\label{def:initial-state}
\orfnote{the word "want" is too vague. Also they don't want to trade
successfully, they "want" to maximize their utility}
\orfnote{how much money do they have? e.g. assume that they have at least
enought to carry out protocol actions. In practice that will be $C_S$ for $S$
and $C_B + P$ for $B$.}
\orfnote{fix parties' capitalization}
A Seller and a buyer want to trade successfully: Both have funds in the given cryptocurrency. The seller is in possession of the physical good.
\end{definition} 


\begin{definition}[Desired Final State]
\label{def:desired-final-state}
The buyer is in possession of the physical good and his funds have decreased by amount $P$. The funds of the seller have increased by $P$.
\end{definition}


We make the following assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All entities have access to the Smart Contract and know the addresses and public keys of each other.
    \label{ass:1}
    \item The seller knows the physical address to which the buyer wants the good to be shipped. This address is not necessarily the buyer's real physical address, he can choose any physical address he wants to protect his privacy.
    \label{ass:2}
    \item Other than the information of assumption \ref{ass:1} and \ref{ass:2}, the buyer and the seller know nothing about each other.
    \label{ass:3}
    \item Both parties can send funds in the given cryptocurrency to any address.
    \label{ass:4}
    \item The sender has the power to send/ship the physical good to any physical address he wants.
    \label{ass:5}
    \item Both the seller and the buyer know the code of the Smart Contract.
    \label{ass:6}
    \item The seller and the buyer behave rationally, meaning that they both want to maximise their expected payout.
    \item Both $U_S(G)$ and $U_B(G)$ are positive. 
\end{enumerate}

We do not analyse transaction fees. 

\minisec{Success of the trade}
The trade is considered successful if the situation transitions from the start
point to the end point. \orfnote{Expand this into sth like: For parties starting
from the Initial State, the Final State is a Nash Equilibrium}

\minisec{Goal}
The goal of this work is to design a protocol in which behaviour that results in a successful trade is a Nash Equilibrium.\newline
No minimal trust should be required. This will be achieved, if it is the rational behaviour for both players to perform the trade. A successful trade should be a Nash Equilibrium: If the other party behaves honestly, the best strategy will be to behave honestly as well.\newline
%If the other party behaves rational it should be best to behave honest.
Another goal is that the trade is incoercible against rational attacks. It
should be unprofitable, but not necessarily impossible, to decrease the payout
of the other party, if the other party is behaving honestly. \orfnote{explain
this last entry better}

\orfnote{The "Success of the trade" seems a bit too mixed with the "goal". Try
to express it in a clear way, maybe even merging the two concepts.}

%\subsection{Implementation}
%The underlying blockchain is immutable as long as there is an honest majority of %miners. We assume this honest majority.

\chapter{Candidate Two-Party Protocols}


\section{First try: no collateral} \orfnote{ Use the word "naive" in the text later.}
To examine any possible solutions, we begin with the simplest possible
protocol. \orfnote{Rephrase this sentence}\newline

The simplest protocol is without collateral nor a third party. In this case there are 3 possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First the buyer sends coins of amount $P$ to the seller and then the seller ships the physical good $G$ to the provided address.
	\item First the seller ships the physical good $G$ to the provided address and then the buyer sends coins of amount $P$ to the seller.
	\item Both parties send the resources simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

%Here maybe a visualization

\minisec{Possible strategies} \orfnote{Make the next 2 phrases more precise.
What other strategies are there? Why do we disregard them? Are we sure they
would not achieve our goal?}
There are many possible strategies for the two players. We will only analyse the strategies where a player plays honestly and the strategies where a player intentionally behaves dishonest to gain an advantage.\newline
In the above described protocols we analyse two strategies for each player. The Buyer can choose between strategy $Pay$ where he behaves honestly and sends the money and strategy $Withhold$ where the Buyer behaves dishonestly and does not send the money. The Seller can choose as well between strategy $Send$ where he sends the good $G$ and strategy $Keep$ where the Buyer does not send the $G$.
\subsection{Game: The Buyer acts first}
\begin{figure}[htb!]

\end{tikzpicture}\newline
\caption{No collateral, Buyer acts first}
\label{fig:nocol-buyer-first}
\end{figure}
%\captionof{figure}{Naive approach, Buyer sends first}

To analyze the game, we use the method "iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies". We start at the bottom at the seller's decision.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Seller chooses $Keep$ (Because $P > P - U_S(G)$).
\end{itemize}
    We then go one step towards the root and look at the Buyer's decision. He already knows that if he chooses $Pay$, the rational Seller will choose $Keep$. This would leave the Buyer with a payout of $-P$. If the Buyer chooses $Withhold$, his payout is $0$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Buyer chooses $Withhold$ (Because $0 > -P$)
\end{itemize} 
%Therefore the Buyer has to choose between a payout of 0 (by choosing $Withhold$) and $-P$ (by choosing $Pay$). Since $0 > -P$, he chooses $Withhold$.\newline
The Nash Equilibrium of this game is \{$Keep$, $Withhold$\} and results in a payout of $0|0$. Both parties are not sending anything and the trade is unsuccessful.

\subsection{Game: The Seller acts first} 

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{tikzpicture}[sibling distance=7cm,level distance=6em,every node/.style={shape=circle,align=center}]
      \node[draw]{$S$}
        child{node[draw]{$B$}
                child[sibling distance = 7cm]{node[shape = rectangle]{$P-U_S(G)|U_B(G)-P$} edge from parent node [left] {$Pay$}} 
                child[sibling distance = 7cm]{node[shape=rectangle]{$-U_S(G)|U_B(G)$}edge from parent node [right] {$Withhold$}} edge from parent node [left] {$Send$}} 
        child{node{0$|$0} edge from parent node [right] {$Keep$}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\label{fig:nocol-seller-first}
\caption{No collateral, Seller acts first}
\end{figure}


The analysis is similar to the above case, but the roles are reversed. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Buyer would choose $Withhold$ as $U_B(G) > U_B(G)-P$
    \item The seller would choose $Keep$ as $0 > -U_S(G)$
\end{itemize}
The Nash Equilibrium of this game is \{$Keep$, $Withhold$\} and results in a payout of $0|0$. Again, both parties are not sending anything and the trade is unsuccessful.

\subsection{Game: Both parties act simultaneously} 

\begin{table}[htb!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ c||c|c| }
    & $Pay$ & $Withhold$  \\
    \hline
    \hline
    $Send$ & $P - U_S(G)|U_B(G) - P$ & $-U_S(G) | U_B(G)$ \\
    \hline
    $Keep$ & $P |-P$ & $0 | 0$ \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{fig:nocol-simultaneous}
    \caption{No collateral: Both parties send simultaneously}
\end{table}
If we look at the payout table we can see that $Withhold$ dominates $Pay$ and $Keep$ dominates $Send$. These strategies provide a bigger payout regardless of the strategy of the other party.
Since we assume the players to be rational, they would both choose the dominant strategy.
Again, the Nash Equilibrium of this game is \{$Keep$, $Withhold$\} and results in a payout of $0|0$. As the Nash Equilibrium does not correspond to the Desired Final State (c.f. Definition \ref{def:desired-final-state}), this game does not satisfy our goal.\newline

It is interesting to note that this table resembles the famous prisoner's dilemma, where the Nash Equilibrium is not Pareto efficient. We can see that \{$Keep$, $Withhold$\} is not the Pareto optimal case, because \{$Send$, $Pay\}$ increases the payout of both parties. 
In other words, a successful trade would benefit both parties but is not happening in this game as it is not the Nash Equilibrium. \niknote{last sentence redundant?}
%TODO explain Prisoners dilemma? Pareto Efficient
%The Nash Equilibrium is on both parties not sending anything, still both parties would yield a bigger payout if they just traded successfully. 


\section{Second Try: One-Sided collateral}  \orfnote{apply earlier notes that also suit here}
To incentivize an entity to behave honestly we introduce collateral. The collateral will be lost if the entity does not behave honestly. In this section we will look at protocols where only one entity deposits a collateral. We introduce a Smart Contract which handles the collateral.

\subsection{Buyer Collateral}
Following protocol is proposed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Buyer deposits collateral $C > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Seller sends the physical good $G$ to the seller
    \item After receiving $G$, the Buyer sends funds of amount $P$ to the seller
    \orfnote{via the Smart Contract}
    \item The Smart Contract releases the collateral of the Buyer
\end{enumerate} \orfnote{Mention that when the Buyer pays, she implicitly
reports to SC that she received the good, so there is no need for a Buyer report
to the SC. OTOH, the Seller could report to SC only in case he cannot send the
good in order to release the Buyer's collateral, but this action is also
useless: If it pays to the Seller more than $P$, he would always do it. If it
pays him less than $P$, this option would be dominated by not sending and lying,
so that the buyer chooses to pay} \orfnote{what if we swapped the order of 2 and
3? Mention it (at least briefly) and that then the Seller could simply not send
the good.}

Because the Smart Contract has access to the blockchain, it can automatically release the collateral if the Buyer sends $P$  to the seller. The collateral should incentivize the Buyer to pay the seller after receiving the physical good $G$.

\subsubsection{Possible Strategies}
With this new protocol there are new possible strategies. Of course there is still the honest strategy for both players ($Send$ and $Pay$), where they behave according to the protocol description. With this strategy the trade unravels successfully.\newline
But there exist other strategies: The dishonest strategy is again not sending the resources. This strategy is again denoted as $Withhold$ (when the buyer does not send the coins) and $Keep$ (when the seller does not send the physical good.\newline
The Buyer can also refuse to pay the collateral to the Smart Contract. This behaviour is denoted as $-C_B$.\newline
When the Seller does not send the physical good in step 2 (plays strategy $Keep$), the Buyer still has to decide if he wants to send $P$ to the seller in order to get back his collateral. Sending $P$ in this scenario is denoted as $P_B$ and not sending $P$ is denoted as $-P_B$.\newline

\minisec{Payout}
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{tikzpicture}[sibling distance=7cm,level distance=6em,every node/.style={shape=circle,align=center}]
      \node[draw]{$B$}
        child{node[draw]{$S$}
                child[sibling distance = 7cm]{node[draw]{$B$}
                		child[sibling distance = 4cm]{node[shape = rectangle]{$P-U_S(G)|U_B(G)-P$} edge from parent node [left] {$Pay$}} 
                		child[sibling distance = 4cm]{node[shape=rectangle]{$-U_S(G)|U_B(G)-C$}edge from parent node [right] {$Withhold$}} edge from parent node [left] {$Send$}} 
                child[sibling distance = 7cm]{node[draw]{$B$}
                child[sibling distance = 3cm]{node[shape = rectangle]{$P|-P$} edge from parent node [left] {$P_B$}} 
                child[sibling distance = 3cm]{node[shape=rectangle]{$0|-C$}edge from parent node [right] {$-P_B$}}edge from parent node [right] {$Keep$}} edge from parent node [left] {$Pay$}} 
          child[sibling distance = 7cm]{node[shape = rectangle]{$0|0$}edge from parent node [right] {$-C_B$}};
\end{tikzpicture}\newline
    \caption{Only the Buyer deposits collateral}
\end{figure}
To analyze the Payout, we again start at the bottom at the Buyer's decision. On the left branch the Buyer would choose $Pay$, as $U_B(G) - P > U_B(G) - C$.\newline
On the right branch the Buyer would choose P$_B$, as $-P > -C$.\newline
Based on these decisions the Seller would choose $Keep$, because $P > P - U_S(G)$.\newline
This means that it is better for the seller to behave maliciously and not send the physical good $G$. The Buyer would send $P$ to get back his collateral but receive nothing more, leaving him with a payout of $-P$. \newline
Since $-P < 0$, the Buyer would choose $-C_B$ and not even deposit the collateral.\newline
The Nash Equilibrium is at \{$-C_B$\} and the trade is unsuccessful.


\subsection{Seller Collateral}
Following protocol is proposed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Seller deposits collateral $C > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer sends funds of amount $P$ to the seller 
    \item Seller sends the physical good to the Buyer
    \item Buyer receives the physical good and confirms it to the Smart Contract
    \item The Smart Contract releases the collateral of the Seller
\end{enumerate}
The collateral should incentivize the Seller to behave honestly and to ship the
physical good to the buyer. The Buyer can report to the SC with a simple boolean input:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0 denotes that $G$ was not received
    \item 1 denotes that $G$ was received
\end{itemize}
%Because of the collateral, behaving honestly should be the best strategy for the seller.
\subsubsection{Possible Strategies}
There is still the honest strategy ($Send$, $Pay$) for both players, where they behave according to the protocol description. With this strategy, the trade still unravels successfully.\newline
The dishonest strategy is again not sending the resources. This strategy is
still denoted as $Withhold$ (when the buyer does not send the coins) and $Keep$
(when the seller does not send the physical good.)\newline
The Buyer also has a unique opportunity: Since he decides what happens to the
collateral, he can coerce the Seller into sending him extra resources. This
strategy will be denoted $C_B$.  After receiving the physical good he can tell
the Seller: "Either you send me back my payment $P$ or I will tell the Smart
Contract that you did not send me the physical good." In this case the Seller
has two possible answers: He can comply and send back $P$ ($C_S$) or not comply
and ignore the message ($-C_S$). \orfnote{there is a problem: even if the Seller
complies, the Buyer may still lie to the SC. The Buyer is indifferent to being
honest or lying, as both choices give her the same payout.}\newline

\caption{Only the Seller deposits collateral}
\end{figure}

To analyze the payout, we again start at the bottom. Since $C>P$, the Seller would comply ($C_S$) on both instances.\newline
On both branches the Buyer chooses $C_B$: \[U_B(G)-P < U_B(G)\] \[-P < 0\]
Based on this information the Seller chooses $Keep$: \[-U_S(G) < 0\]
That means that both options for the Buyer would result in a payout of $0|0$. It does not matter which option he chooses.\newline
The Nash Equilibrium is again at $0|0$ and the trade not successful.\newline
%If $B$ sends the coins (does not choose strategy $Withhold$), $S$ has to make the following decision: Does he send the good ($Send$) or not ($Keep$)? We have to take into account, that $B$ decides what happens with the collateral. \newline
%If $S$ does not behave honestly (does not send the good), $B$ can punish $S$ by reporting 0 to the Smart contract. This means, that the collateral would not be given back to $S$.
What was designed to be an incentive for $S$ to behave honestly, ended up as leverage for $B$ over $S$. $B$ can report 0 (and burn the collateral) even if $S$ behaves honestly. 
%Therefore $B$ can use this leverage to coerce $S$ into giving him extra resources: “Give me C/2 coins or I will report 0 to the Smart Contract and burn your collateral.“
%Since sending the good has no impact on the collateral (the rational buyer will always play strategy $C_B$ over $Pay$), it is best for $S$ to not send the physical good ($Withhold$).
%Because not Sending ($Keep$) is the best strategy for the seller, it is best for $B$ to not even send P and therefore not engage in the trade at all ($Withhold$).\newline
%The Nash Equilibrium would be in nobody sending anything and the trade not happening.

\subsubsection{Both parties report}
\orfnote{Having "Both parties report" be at the same level as the previous
"Possible strategies" is misleading.}
One Side Collateral on the Seller's side does not work if only the Buyer reports
to the Smart Contract (5.2.2) \orfnote{use label/reference}. If only the Buyer reports, he has all the power and can report anything he wants to the Smart Contract.\newline
Another option would be that both players report to the Smart Contract if the physical good $G$ was sent and received.\newline
Also, instead of sending the Payment $P$ directly to the Seller, the Buyer will
send the payment to the Smart Contract. \orfnote{Isn't the payment always routed
through the smart contract anyway?} The Smart Contract will then, if both parties behave honestly, forward the payment to the Seller. This hands more power to the Smart Contract. With control over the collateral and the payment it has more options to punish dishonest behaviour.\newline 
If the two players report a different value, then the Smart Contract will slash
the collateral, as one party has to be lying \orfnote{whereas if the parties
agree, their collateral is returned}. If they both report 0 ($G$ was not sent),
then the Smart Contract will send $P$ back to the Buyer, because $G$ was not
shipped. If they both report 1 ($G$ was sent), then the Smart Contract will send
$P$ to the Seller and the trade was \orfnote{was $\rightarrow$ will be} successful.\newline

\orfnote{The} Following protocol is proposed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Seller deposits collateral $C > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer sends funds of amount $P$ to the Smart Contract 
    \item Seller sends the physical good to the Buyer and the Buyer receives it
    \item Buyer and Seller report the physical transaction to the Smart Contract
    \item The Smart Contract releases the collateral of the Seller
\end{enumerate}
There are multiple ways to implement step 4: Either the two parties report one after another or they report simultaneously.
\subsubsection{The Seller reports first} \orfnote{this should be an inner
section to "Both parties report", not at the same level}
As the Buyer reports last, this protocol still gives the Buyer the power of
burning the collateral of the Seller by reporting exactly the opposite from the
Seller's report.\newline
Therefore he can still coerce the Seller into sending him back his payment. This
strategy will be denoted as $C_B$. As we already have shown above, a rational
seller will comply and send back the payment $P$ (this last decision will be
omitted from the tree \orfnote{which leaf of the tree?} for better readability).\newline

\minisec{How to report simultaneously}
 Every transaction to the Smart Contract is public. As the players have to
 report to the Smart Contract by sending a public transaction, the other player
 also knows what the first player reported. By just demanding both to report at
 the same time, the player who reports second always knows what value the first player reported. Then the report is not really simultaneous.\newline

 We can fix this problem by using a (at least) \orfnote{what do you mean "at
 least"?} computationally hiding and binding commitment scheme. Both players would commit to their decision and send the commitment to the SC. The second player sees the commitment of the first player. Because the commitment scheme is computationally hiding and we assume the players to be computationally bounded, the commitment does not reveal any information about the actual decision of the first player. \newline
 After both players send the commitment to the SC, they both send the opening
 value for their commitment to the SC. As the commitment is computationally
 binding, the players cannot change what they initially reported. If a player
 does not send an opening value after a predefined time, the SC punishes the
 player by sending all the funds to the other player.

\section{Two side collateral}
\label{sec:two-side-collateral}
\orfnote{As we saw in the previous section,} One side collateral does
\orfnote{not lead to a game that achieves our goal} not work. The party that does not deposit collateral always has an unfair advantage over the other party. \newline
When only the Buyer deposits collateral, the Seller has no incentive to send $G$. \newline
When only the Seller deposits collateral, the Buyer can coerce the Seller into sending back his payment $P$, because the Buyer can burn the collateral by reporting 0.\newline 

We introduce another protocol that addresses this \orfnote{these} problems. In this protocol both parties deposit collateral. This should incentivize the parties to both behave honestly.\newline
If the two parties report something different, the Smart Contract will slash the collateral of both players, as it can not determine which party is lying. If both parties report 0, the Smart Contract will send the payment $P$ back to the Buyer. If both parties report 1, the Smart Contract will send the payment $P$ to the Seller.  \newline

Again, there are three possible ways of handling the reports:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Seller reports first
    \item The Buyer reports first
    \item Both players report simultaneously
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Seller reports first}
Following protocol is proposed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Seller deposits collateral $C_S > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer deposits collateral $C_B > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer sends funds of amount $P$ \orfnote{sends $P$ coins} to the Smart
    Contract \orfnote{this step could be combined with the previous one}
    \item Seller sends physical good $G$ to the seller and reports it to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer receives the physical good and confirms \orfnote{reports} it to the Smart Contract
    \item The Smart Contract releases the collateral of the Seller and the Buyer and sends $P$ to the Seller
\end{enumerate}
\minisec{Possible strategies}
As always, $Send$ denotes the honest strategy, where the Seller sends $G$ and $Keep$ denotes the dishonest strategy where the Seller does not send the $G$.

\minisec{Payout}
To increase readability, we do not plot the decisions from point 1 to point 3 of
the protocol. If someone does not deposit the collateral, the Smart Contract
aborts the trade and the payout is $0|0$. If the Buyer refuses to pay $P$ (step
3), he loses his collateral and the payout is $0|-C_B$.\newline

The Seller would choose option 8, as 
\[P>P-U_S(G)>0>-U_S(G)\]
Because the payout of the Buyer is $-P<0$, he would not engage in this trade and therefore refuse to pay the collateral in step 1. The trade is still unsuccessful.

To analyze the payout, we start at the bottom of the tree. The Seller would choose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 over 2 ($-U_S(G) > -U_S(G) -C_S$)
    \item 4 over 3 ($P -U_S(G) > -U_S(G) -C_B$)
    \item 5 over 6 ($0 > -C_S$)
    \item 8 over 7 ($P >-C_S$)

The Buyer would choose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 over 4 ($U_B(G) > U_B(G) - P$)
    \item 5 over 8 ($0 > -P$)
\end{itemize}
The Buyer would always report 0, no matter if the Seller was honest or not.\newline
The Seller chooses $Keep$, as 
\[0>-U_S(G)\]
The Seller will never send $G$ in this game and the trade is unsuccessful.

\subsection{Simultaneous report}
Following protocol is proposed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Seller deposits collateral $C_S > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer deposits collateral $C_B > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer sends Funds of amount $P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Seller sends physical good $G$ to the seller
    \item Both players report whether $G$ was shipped
    \item The Smart Contract releases the collateral of the Seller and the Buyer and sends $P$ to the seller
\end{enumerate}
\minisec{Possible strategies}
As always, $Send$ denotes the honest strategy, where the Seller sends $G$ and $Keep$ denotes the dishonest strategy where the Seller does not send the $G$.

\minisec{Payout}
To increase readability, we do not plot the decisions from point 1 to point 3. If someone does not deposit the collateral, the Smart Contract aborts the trade and the payout is $0|0$. If the Buyer refuses to pay $P$ (step 3), he loses his collateral. The payout is $0|-C_B$.\newline

The subgame $T_1$ has two Nash Equilibria: $\{0_B, 0_S\}$ and $\{1_B, 1_S\}$.\newline
The payout of $\{0_B, 0_S\}$ is $-U_S(G)|U_B(G)$. The payout of $\{1_B, 1_S\}$ is $P-U_S(G)|U_B(G)-P$.

The subgame $T_2$ has the same two Nash Equilibria as well: $\{0_B, 0_S\}$ and $\{1_B, 1_S\}$.\newline
The payout of $\{0_B, 0_S\}$ is $0|0$. The payout of $\{1_B, 1_S\}$ is $P|-P$.\newline

The Seller decides if he wants to enter subgame $T_1$ or $T_2$. To analyse his decision we look at his payout from each subgame:\newline
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $T_1$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\{0_B, 0_S\}: -U_S(G)$
            \item $\{1_B, 1_S\}: P-U_S(G)$
        \end{itemize}
    \item $T_2$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\{0_B, 0_S\}: 0$
            \item $\{1_B, 1_S\}: P$
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
If we compare these 4 possible payouts:
\[P > P-U_S(G) > 0 > -U_S(G)\]
Without any additional assumptions, it is unclear which is the better subgame for the Seller. He can not choose which subgame is beneficial for him. \newline
We have created a situation where the players do not have all the information they need to choose the best option. That also means, that they are not motivated to behave honestly as they do not know if this is indeed the most beneficial behaviour. As the players are not motivated to behave honestly, they would not trade successfully in this protocol.

\section{An extra input is needed}
The Smart Contract plays an important role in the two side collateral protocol. We want to create a Smart Contract that rewards honest behaviour and punishes dishonest behaviour.\newline 
Problems arise, because the Smart Contract does not know if the physical good $G$ was actually sent to the Buyer. Because of this missing information, it is impossible for the Smart Contract to settle disputes.
\subsection{Ideal Functionality}
We can achieve the ideal functionality of our Smart Contract by giving it the
information whether the good was actually shipped as an input. We model the
ideal behaviour with a function taking 6 inputs and giving 2 outputs.
\orfnote{mention that this ideal functionality is unrealizable without some
trusted party that always reports truthfully to SC}

}
\end{lstlisting}
    \caption{General Code for the ideal functionality}
\end{figure}
The honest and nonsensical case can be implemented without the last input. There are multiple possible solutions.\newline
The important case is when the seller reports that he shipped the good and the Buyer reports that he did not receive it. Because the Smart Contract has the input 'shipped', it can determine which party is lying and which party is telling the truth.\newline
The Smart Contract settles the disputes in such a way that the honest party has a payout greater than zero and the lying party has a payout smaller than zero. Therefore it is unfavorable for any party to report wrongfully.\newline
It is important to see that the outputs of the function have to be implemented
like this, to achieve the ideal functionality. \orfnote{We will now see why the
function outputs are defined in this way ...}\newline

\orfnote{what is a "general payout"?}
\minisec{Honest Seller}
The honest Seller (line 11) ships the good to the Buyer and deposits collateral $C_S$. To have a positive general payout, his lowest possible payout from the smart Contract is $P + C_S$. His general payout is at least
\[P + C_S - C_S - U_S(G) = P - U_S(G) > 0\]

\minisec{Lying Buyer}
The Lying Buyer (line 12) receives $G$ and deposits collateral $C_S$ and Price $P$ to the Smart Contract. To have a negative general payout, his payout from the smart Contract has to be less than $P + Col_B - U_B(G)$. His general payout is less than
\[P + C_B - U_B(G) + U_B(G) - C_B -P = 0\]

\minisec{Dishonest Seller}
The dishonest Seller deposits collateral $C_S$ but does not ship the good $G$. To have a negative general payout, payout from the smart Contract has to be less than $C_S$. His general payout is less than
\[C_S - C_S = 0\]

\minisec{Honest Buyer}
The honest Buyer deposits collateral $C_S$ and Price $P$. To have a positive general payout, his payout from the smart Contract has to be greater than $P + C_S$. His general payout is greater than
\[P + C_S - C_S - P = 0\]

\subsection{Ideal Smart Contract solves the proposed problem}
In the following section we will show that an implementation of the ideal functionality of the Smart Contract indeed creates a game where a successful trade is the Nash Equilibrium. We first write an easy implementation of the ideal SC and then determine the Nash Equilibrium of the created game.
\subsubsection{Implementation of ideal Smart Contract}
The easiest implementation of the honest case is to give back their collateral. If the good was actually shipped, the Seller will be awarded coins of amount $P$, otherwise those coins go back to the Buyer.\newline
In the nonsensical case the SC will not give any coins back.\newline
In the case of a dispute the SC rewards all the coins to the honest party.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
function assign_coins(
  buyerCol: natural, sellerCol: natural, price: natural,
  sellerSent: bool, buyerRecv: bool, shipped: bool
) -> (int /* seller coins */, int /* buyer coins */) {
  if sellerSent == buyerRecv { 
    sellerCoins = sellerCol // give back the collateral
    buyerCoins = buyerCol //give back the collateral
    if shipped{sellerCoins += price} // G was shipped, Seller gets price
    else {buyerCoins += price}// G was not shipped, Buyer gets price
    }
  if (not sellerSent) and buyerRecv { 
    sellerCoins = 0 //nonsensical case, give both parties no coins
    buyerCoins = 0
  }

  // both claim they went through and the other player failed
  if shipped {
    sellerCoins = price + sellerCol + buyerCol // honest seller
    buyerCoins =  0 //lying Buyer
  } else {
    sellerCoins = 0 // lying seller
    buyerCoins = price + sellerCol + buyerCol // honest buyer
  }
  return (sellerCoins, buyerCoins)
}
\end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Example Code for an implementation of the ideal Smart Contract}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Protocol}
Similar to section 5.3, following protocol is proposed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Seller deposits collateral $C_S > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer deposits collateral $C_B > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer sends Funds of amount $P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Seller sends physical good $G$ to the seller and reports it to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer receives the physical good and confirms it to the Smart Contract
    \item The Smart Contract releases the collateral of the Seller and the Buyer and sends $P$ to the seller
\end{enumerate}

Remark: If any party does not send the collateral, the Smart Contract will release the collateral of the the other party and it would result in a payout of $0|0$. This option is not analyzed in the Game tree but has to be considered as an option for each party.\newline

We again start at the bottom of the tree at the Buyer's decision. A rational Buyer would choose 2,4,5,7. Out of these options the Seller would choose outcome 4 ($Send,1$), as this is the best outcome for him.\newline
The Nash Equilibrium is at \{$Send$, 1, 1\} and the trade would unravel successfully.\newline

Such a smart contract solves the problem completely as the Nash Equilibrium lies in both parties behaving honestly.
%TODO It resembles the case of shipping a digital verifiable good. %quote the paper that solved this problem
\subsection{Real World Functionality}
In the real world, the smart contract does not have the last input
(bool:shipped) \orfnote{have the last input (bool:shipped) $\rightarrow$ know
the ground truth}. Therefore the Smart Contract does not know if the physical good was actually shipped or not. \newline
This poses the following problem: The last input \orfnote{ground truth} is needed to settle disputes. Even if all the other inputs are the same, the output of the ideal functionality depends on the last input. Without this input, previously different scenarios become indistinguishable for the Smart Contract.\newline
For example, it is impossible to differentiate between a lying seller that did not send the good $G$ but says he did, and a lying Buyer that received the good but says he did not.\newline 
Without the sixth input, it is impossible to design a Smart Contract that achieves the ideal functionality described in section 5.4.1.
\orfnote{do not hardcode section numbers, use labels/references instead}
\orfnote{I would really like to present this argument in a theorem-proof format}

\chapter{A redesigned game}
As we have shown (c.f. \ref{sec:formal-proof}) \orfnote{we have to discuss what will be the fate of the
proof}, it is not possible (under our assumptions) to design a protocol that would create a successful game (as described in \ref{sec:the-game}). The biggest problem is that we have no reliable way of telling the Smart Contract whether the physical good $G$ was actually shipped or not. If there is a dispute, the Smart Contract does not know which party is lying and has to be punished.\newline

We need to rework our assumptions and requirements for the game we want to design. For that it is is interesting to see that the two side collateral protocol (c.f. \ref{sec:two-side-collateral}) is very close to achieving our goals. As already discussed, the problem is that the Seller is not actually incentivized to send the physical good $G$, because the Buyer is not incentivized to report his dishonest behaviour. The Buyer gets a bigger Payout when he lies to the Smart Contract instead of reporting the dishonest behaviour. Therefore a rational Buyer would never punish a dishonest Seller in this scenario. If a Seller thinks that the Buyer would punish him (the Buyer is not acting rational in this scenario), then the Seller is incentivized to send the physical good $G$.\newline
\section{Two Side Collateral with truthful Buyer} 
In this section we show that if the Buyer behaves truthful (and therefore not rationally), it is not beneficial for the Seller to behave dishonestly. The created game would have a successful trade as Nash Equilibrium.\newline

Now a truthful Buyer stops acting rationally and chooses option 7 over 8.\newline
The Buyer chooses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 over 2 ($U_B(G) > U_B(G) -P -C_B$)
    \item 4 over 3 ($U_B(G) - P > U_B(G) -P -C_B$)
    \item 5 over 6 ($0 > -P -C_B$)
    \item 7 over 8 (irrational decision)
\end{itemize}
The Seller would choose option 4, as 
\[P-U_S(G)>0>-U_S(G)>-C_S\]
The Seller now sends the good, because he the Buyer will punish him if he does not send it.
The Nash Equilibrium would be the honest case and the trade would unravel successfully.\newline

At first glance this seems counterintuitive: If the act of reporting benefits the Buyer, why would the rational Buyer not report the misbehaviour of the Seller? As the definition of a rational behaviour is maximizing the own Utility, would it not be rational to report the Seller?
The answer to this question is no. If the Seller has already misbehaved, it is more profitable for the Buyer to not report the misbehaviour, as he at least receives back his collateral.
It is not the act of reporting that is profitable for the Buyer, rather it is
the threat of reporting. This thread has to be considered by the Seller before he chooses whether to misbehave. If the Seller thinks that maybe the Buyer will report him, he is discouraged of trying to cheat and not sending $G$.\newline

The problem lies in the way we laid the rules for the game: As we defined both players as always behaving rationally, the Seller knows that the Buyer can not report him, because it is not the rational decision.
If the Seller did not know that the Buyer is always acting rational, he would be taking a great risk by not sending the physical good: the risk of being exposed and losing his collateral and his money $P$.
We want to create a situation where the Seller evaluates the situation as being too risky to cheat. In this situation the rational Seller will behave honestly and  send $G$.
To conclude: It is sufficient to turn the non credible threat of the Buyer (reporting 0 if $G$ is not shipped) into a credible threat for the double collateral protocol to succeed.\newline

We redesign the game by adding another Entity. Its purpose is to assist the Buyer in convincing the Seller that he will be punished if he does not send $G$. It turns the non credible threat of the Seller's misbehaviour being reported into a credible threat. We need this Entity to maintain the rationality of the Buyer, as a rational Buyer will not report any misbehaviour of the Seller.
If this is achieved, a Seller knows that it is unprofitable to not send $G$.\newline


\section{Formal definition of the new Entity}
\niknote{Maybe change title to "formally redesigning the game"}
We introduce another entity, which we call Mediator $M$: and has the following behaviour:
\begin{definition}[Mediator]
\label{def:mediator}
An Entity $M$ that has the purpose to protect the Buyer from an misbehaving Seller. $M$ has the following behaviour:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item receive SC address and specifications that describe $G$
    \item receive the physical good
    \item check if the the physical good match the description for $G$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if so: report 1 to the SC and send the good to the Buyer
        \item else: destroy the good and report 0 to the SC
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The new Entity is not modeled as a rational party. It always behaves in the described way. It has its own physical address and the power to receive physical items. Given the right specifications of $G$, the Mediator can distinguish $G$ from every other  physical item. The Mediator also has the power to communicate with the Smart Contract and the Buyer. It is trusted by the Buyer to evaluate if the good sent by the Seller is indeed $G$.
//TODO Maybe expand on that: What about trust
\section{Mediated protocol}
We propose the following protocol:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Buyer gives SC address and specifications for $G$ to the Mediator
    \item Seller deposits collateral $C_S > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer deposits collateral $C_B > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer sends Funds of amount $P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Seller sends physical good $G$ to the Mediator and reports it to the Smart Contract
    \item Mediator receives the physical good, confirms it to the Smart Contract and sends $G$ to the Buyer
    \item The Smart Contract releases the collateral of the Seller and the Buyer and sends $P$ to the seller
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}
\subsection{Honest behaviour}
This new protocol does change the honest behaviour of the Buyer. His honest behaviour is now:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Tell the right SC address and the right specifications for $G$ to the Mediator
    \item Deposit $C_B>P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Send funds of amount $P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Wait and receive $G$ from the Mediator
\end{enumerate}
It is important that the Buyer no longer reports to the Smart Contract, as this responsibility is handed over to the Mediator.\newline
The honest behaviour of the Seller remains unchanged by the new protocol. It still is:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Deposit $C_S>P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Send $G$ to the provided address (which is now the Mediator's)
    \item Report to the Smart Contract  that $G$ was sent
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Possible Strategies}
The new protocol has no impact on the possible strategies for the Seller. He still has the option to either send ($Send$) or not send ($Keep$) the physical good. After that, he has the option to report 0 or 1 to the Smart Contract.\newline
As the Buyer does not longer report to the Smart Contract, he has fewer decisions to make. As soon as he enters the trade (pays the collateral and $P$ to the SC), he no longer has any decision to make. The Mediator will take care of reporting to the Smart Contract.

\subsubsection{Payout}
We again start our analysis at point 5 of the protocol.\newline

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Two Side Collateral with ideal Mediator}
\end{figure}

\orfnote{Why does $S$ report before $M$? Discuss. Mention that, at the end of
the day, since this game works and we achieved our goal, we don't really care
about small differences like this.}
The Mediator always behaves in the same way
\orfnote{this sentence is confusing: it could be interpreted as "the Mediator
always sends the same bit to SC", which is wrong}. Therefore the Seller can
choose the one option which yields him the biggest payout. This is sending the good ($Send$) and reporting 1, as: 

\[P-U_S(G)>0>-C_S>-U_S(G) - C_S\]

It is the best option for the Seller to behave honestly.\newline
As completing the trade honestly is also profitable for the Buyer, this protocol solves the problem.


\section{Possible realizations of Mediator}
The Mediator, as it is defined in 6.1, is a theoretical Entity. In the following section we will discuss some practical attempts to realize the Mediator.
\subsection{Friend of Buyer reports}
As the Buyer has to trust the Mediator, one possible approach is choosing a loyal friend of the Buyer to be the Mediator. It is important that he is loyal to the Buyer, meaning that he will not betray the Buyer and keep the physical good $G$ to himself. The Buyer fully trusts his loyal friend. 
\minisec{Modeling the Friend}
The friend will not act rational, as he does not want to maximize his own Utility. He rather wants to maximize the Buyer's utility. Therefore he will always choose the option that maximizes the payout of the Buyer.\newline
The Friend(F) will receive the physical good $G$ and check if it matches the agreed good. After that, he reports 0 (received the good successfully) or 1 (did not receive the good successfully) to the Smart Contract. After that he will send the $G$ to the Buyer.

\minisec{Protocol}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Seller and Buyer deposit Collateral to the SC
    \item Buyer sends $P$ to the SC
    \item Seller ships $G$ to the Friend of the Buyer and reports 1/0 to the SC
    \item Friend of the Seller reports 1/0 to the SC
    \item Friend sends $G$ to the Buyer
\end{enumerate}

\minisec{Friend is not the ideal Mediator} \orfnote{Walk the reader through the
friend's behaviour in case the seller doesn't send $G$ but lies to $SC$. Mention
that, at the crucial moment, the Friend will behave exactly like the Buyer so it
doesn't solve the problem.}
We modeled the friend as being loyal to the Buyer. He wants to maximize the utility of the Buyer.\newline
That means that he will always choose the behaviour that benefits the Buyer. Therefore he is not suited as being the Mediator. He does not achieve the same functionality as the ideal Mediator proposed in 6.1, as he will not always report truthfully to the Smart Contract.\newline
As the Seller knows this, he can take advantage of it. He knows that he will not be punished if he does not send the physical good. The friend as Mediator is not a credible threat to the Seller. Therefore a rational Seller will not send the good and not behave honestly in this setting. 
\minisec{Payout}
To increase readability, we do not plot the decisions from point 1 to point 3.
If someone does not deposit the collateral, the Smart Contract aborts the trade
and the payout is $0|0$. If the Buyer refuses to pay $P$ (step 3), he loses his
collateral. The payout is $0|-C_B$.\newline

\begin{tikzpicture}[sibling distance=7cm,level distance=6em,every node/.style={shape=circle,align=center}]
    \node[draw]{$S$}
        child[sibling distance = 8cm]{node[draw]{$S$}
    		child[sibling distance = 4cm]{node[draw]{F}
    		    child[sibling distance = 3cm]{node{1} edge from parent node [left] {0}}

    		    child[sibling distance = 3cm]{node{4} edge from parent node [right] {1}}edge from parent node [right] {1}}edge from parent node [left] {$Send$}} 
        child[sibling distance = 8cm]{node[draw]{$S$}
            child[sibling distance = 4cm]{node[draw]{F}
                child[sibling distance = 3cm]{node{5} edge from parent node [left] {0}}
    		    child[sibling distance = 3cm]{node{6} edge from parent node [right] {1}}edge from parent node [left] {0}}
            child[sibling distance = 4cm]{node[draw]{F}
                child[sibling distance = 3cm]{node{7} edge from parent node [left] {0}}
    		    child[sibling distance = 3cm]{node{8} edge from parent node [right] {1}}edge from parent node [right] {1}}edge from parent node [right] {$Keep$}};
\end{tikzpicture}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| }
\hline
& Payout  \\
\hline
\hline
1& $-U_S(G) | U_B(G)$\\
\hline
2& $-U_S(G) - C_S| U_B(G)- P - C_B $\\
\hline
3&$P-U_S(G) - C_S | U_B(G) -P - C_B$ \\
\hline
4& $P-U_S(G)| U_B(G)-P$\\
\hline
5& $0|0$\\
\hline 
6& $-C_S |-P - C_B$\\
\hline
7& $- C_S| -P-C_S$\\
\hline
8& $P| -P$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We again start at the bottom of the tree to analyze the payout. As F wants to maximize the payout of the Buyer, he will choose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 over 2 ($U_B(G) > U_B(G) -P -C_B$)
    \item 4 over 3 ($U_B(G) - P > U_B(G) -P -C_B$)
    \item 5 over 6 ($0 > -P -C_B$)
    \item 8 over 7 ($-P > -P -C_B)$)
\end{itemize}
The Seller would choose option 8, as 
\[P>P-U_S(G)>0>-U_S(G)\]
Because the payout of the Buyer is $-P<0$, he would not engage in this trade and therefore refuse to pay the collateral in step 1. The trade is still unsuccessful.\newline

Introducing a friend as the Mediator does not solve the problem. The tree and
the payout are exactly the same as in the two-sided collateral protocol (c.f. \ref{fig:two-side-collateral}). As the Seller knows that F will act in the best interest of the Buyer, he can still misbehave without being punished.
To solve the problem we need to come up with a Mediator that is fully trusted by
the Buyer, but is not trying to maximize the Buyer's payout.
Every entity that maximizing the payout for the Buyer will not be a
credible threat to the Seller.


\subsection{Postal Office reports}
In our formal analysis we assumed that there is a way for the physical item $G$ to be reliably shipped. In practice physical goods are usually shipped by a another party (Post office/shipping company).
Therefore the parties have to trust the Postal Office (PO) to actually deliver the good. Because the parties already trust the PO, the PO can also report to the Smart Contract and thereby act as the Mediator.
\minisec{Protocol}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Buyer gives SC address and specifications for $G$ to the Postal Office
    \item Seller and Buyer deposit Collateral to the SC
    \item Buyer sends $P$ to the SC
    \item Seller hands $G$ to the Postal Office and reports to the SC
    \item Postal Office checks if the good is correct and reports 1/0 to the SC
    \item Postal Office ships $G$ to the Buyer
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Postal Office realises ideal Mediator}
An honest Postal Office realises the ideal Mediator as defined in 6.1:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It receives the SC address and specifications that describe G
    \item It receives the physical good from the Seller
    \item It checks, if the received good matches the specifications for $G$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item YES: \orfnote{if so,} it reports 1 and sends the good to the Buyer
            \item NO: \orfnote{else} it reports 0 and destroys the good
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
As the Postal Office has to be trusted by the Buyer, it meets the requirements to being the ideal mediator. We have already shown (6.2) that a practical implementation of the ideal Mediator would solve our problem. Therefore the Postal Office reporting to the Smart Contract and thereby acting as Mediator is a viable solution to the problem.
\minisec{Trust in the Postal Office}
Although this solution with the PO as Mediator achieves an incoercible sale of the physical good $G$, both parties still have to trust the Postal Office behave honestly.\newline
In addition to that, the Postal Office now knows the specifications of the good being shipped. This means that there is less privacy for the Buyer and the Seller. If the physical good that is being shipped is very valuable, it opens up possible attacks by the Postal Office.\newline

-po has to be big/trusted enough\newline
-exit scams?
\minisec{Difference Postal Office and Escrow}
The big difference between the Postal Office and traditional third party escrow is that the PO does not handle the money. \newline
In traditional third party escrows, the escrow has to be trusted with the good and the money. As it is in possession of both, it opens up possibilities to scam the Buyer and the Seller out of both the money and the physical good.\newline
As the postal Office is only holding on to the physical good, the reward of a
possible scam is less than if it also had control of the money.
\orfnote{approximately half, assuming that $U_{PO}(G) \approx P$}\newline
We trust the PO by default? Third party escrow is third rational party therefore can scam, but PO is not modeled as rational party? kind of cheating
\subsection{Machine reports}
If we can build a machine that can recognize $G$ reliably, we can completely eliminate trust. This machine can act as the Mediator. It does not make decisions, it simply takes inputs and acts accordingly.\newline
The inputs it takes are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The address of the SC
    \item Specifications that describe $G$
    \item The physical good $G$
\end{itemize}

The Mediator now is a deterministic machine in contrast to a third Entity. This
has the advantage that both the Buyer and the Seller know that the Machine will
behave exactly as it is programmed to do. There is no need of trust anymore.
\orfnote{mention that the machine can presumably use image recognition, be cheap
and open source, therefore both parties can verify its code and the seller can
easily believe that the buyer can have such a machine, thus eliminating trust}\newline

\subsubsection{Behaviour of the Machine}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It receives the SC address and specifications that describe G
    \item It receives the physical good from the Seller
    \item It checks, if the received good matches the specifications for $G$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item if so: it reports 1 and sends the good to the Buyer
            \item else: it reports 0 and destroys the good
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
A Machine with this behaviour is realising the ideal Mediator from 6.1. 

\subsubsection{Protocol}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Machine releases PK and physical address
    \item Buyer gives SC address and specifications for G to the Machine
    \item Seller and Buyer deposit Collateral to the SC
    \item Buyer sends $P$ to the SC
    \item Seller hands $G$ to the Machine and reports to the SC
    \item Machine checks if the good is correct and reports to the SC
    \item Machine ships $G$ to the Buyer
\end{enumerate}
As the machine realises an ideal ideal Mediator (6.1), this protocol achieves an incoercible sale of $G$.\newline
In addition to that, no trust is needed as the Mediator is not able to behave differently. It will always behave as it was programmed to behave. Therefore it is not able to perform any kind of scam.

\subsubsection{Realizability of the machine} 
The biggest challenge for the machine is to determine if the provided good actually matches the specifications.\newline
We believe that a machine which behaves exactly as we described is could be
realised using artificial intelligence. \orfnote{expand a bit. Mention image/3d
object recognition. Find references}
\section{Difference from trusted third party/ Escrow}
How is the reporting entity different than an escrow?
-only buyer has to trust?
-Maybe even model rational: misbehaving is doing more damage to the company/manufacturer than behaving exactly as described -> then no trust is necessary -> but then we can us it as a clean middleman that reports to the SC
\chapter{Open Research/ Questions}

\chapter{Conclusion}

\chapter{Appendix}

\section{Formal proof}
\label{sec:formal-proof}
In this section we provide a proof showing that (under our Assumptions) there can not exist  a successful game G as it is defined in 4.2.

\minisec{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item if the other party behaves honestly or rationally, it will be the best strategy to behave honestly
    \item $U_S(G)$ and $U_B(G)$ are constants $> 0$
    \item All Payments go through the smart Contract
    \item The players only interact with each other and the Smart Contract. There are no other entities involved.
    \item The entities interact with the SC with transactions. The payoff from the SC does only depend on these transactions.
    \item The Smart Contract handles the payoff after receiving all the transactions.
    \item The seller can post $Tx\_honest_S$, even if he does not send $G$. There is no mechanism for the Buyer to prevent the seller from posting $Tx_honest_S$.

\end{enumerate}

\minisec{General payout function}

We introduce a general payout functions $P_B$ and $P_S$, that take two strategies as input and output the overall payout that a player receives when playing this strategy.\newline
A strategy is a set of decisions that define the behaviour of a player. %TODO: MAYBE PRELIMINARIES? LOOK AT THAT AGAIN
%Questions: How to model strategy, since payout is also dependent on opponent, assume minmax?\newline


\[P_S : \{ \textit{set of Seller strategies}\} \times \{ \textit{set of Buyer strategies}\} \to \mathbb{R}\]
\[P_B : \{ \textit{set of Seller strategies}\} \times \{ \textit{set of Buyer strategies}\} \to \mathbb{R}\]
%\[P_S : \{ \textit{set of strategies}\} \to \mathbb{R} \]
The honest strategy for each player ($honest_S, honest_B$) is behaving according to the agreed protocol.
\minisec{Transactions}
DEFINE $T$ as the set of all possible Transaction SETS. TODO think about that again.\newline
When both parties behave honestly both parties post numerous transactions to the Smart Contract. We call the set of transactions that an honest Seller posts $Tx\_honest_S$ and the transaction from an honest Buyer $Tx\_honest_B$.

\minisec{payout from the SC}
We introduce functions $SC_B$ and $SC_S$ that take as input all transactions to the Smart Contract and output the corresponding Payout from the Smart Contract:

\[ SC_S : \{T\} \times \{T\} \to \mathbb{R} \]
\[ SC_B : \{T\} \times \{T\} \to \mathbb{R} \]

\minisec{Begin formal proof}
Let us assume there exists a successful Game $G$ (as defined in 4.2). That means
\begin{equation}
    \forall s \in \{\textit{set of Seller strategies}\}: P_S(s, honest_B) \leq P_S(honest_S,honest_B)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \forall s \in \{\textit{set of Buyer strategies}\}: P_B(honest_S, s) \leq P_B(honest_S,honest_B)
\end{equation}
It is the best strategy to behave honestly if the other party behaves honestly as well.\newline


%In addition the game should be incoercible, meaning that the other party has no dishonest strategy that decreases the payout from the first party:
%I think this is a inreasonable assumption. How to model incoercible?
%\begin{equation}
 %   \forall s \in \{\textit{set of Buyer strategies}\}: P_S(honest_S, s) \geq P_S(honest_S,honest_B)
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
 %   \forall s \in \{\textit{set of Seller strategies}\}: P_B(s, honest_B) \geq P_B(honest_S,honest_B)
%\end{equation}
\minisec{Payout honest case}
\begin{equation}
    P_B(honest_S,honest_B) = SC_B(Tx\_honest_S, Tx\_honest_B) + U_B(G))
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
    P_S(honest_S,honest_B) = SC_S(Tx\_honest_S, Tx\_honest_B) - U_S(G) 
\end{equation}

As $U_B(G)$ is a constant, from (8.2 and 8.3):
\begin{equation}
    \forall Tx_B \in \{T\}: SC_B(Tx\_honest_S, Tx_B) \leq SC_B(Tx\_honest_S, Tx\_honest_B)
\end{equation}
If the seller posts the transactions $Tx\_honest_S$, posting the transactions $Tx\_honest_B$ will give $B$ the biggest payout from the Smart Contract.
\minisec{Payout dishonest seller}
Strategy $dishonestSeller$: In this strategy the seller behaves according to the agreed protocol (and posts the exact same transactions to the Smart Contract as if he was honest), but does not send the physical good $G$ to the Buyer.\newline
His payout is (dependent on the buyers strategy $S_B$ (and Transactions $Tx_B$)):
\begin{equation}
    P_S(dishonestSeller,S_B) = SC_S(Tx\_honest_S,Tx_B)
\end{equation}
As the dishonest seller does not send the item, his payout is exactly the amount of coins that he gets from the smart contract.\newline

\minisec{It is profitable for the seller to behave malicious}
We already showed, that if the seller posts the transactions $Tx\_honest_S$, posting $Tx\_honest_B$ yields the biggest payout for $B$ (8.5).\newline
Therefore the rational $B$ will always post $Tx\_honest_B$ if the Seller posts $Tx\_honest_A$, even if the protocol requires a different behaviour. We call this strategy (posting $Tx\_honest_B$) $Post\_Tx\_honest_B$.\newline
The general payout of a Seller using strategy $dishonestSeller$ is:

\begin{equation}
    P_S(dishonestSeller,Post\_Tx\_honest_B) = SC_S(Tx\_honest_S,Tx\_honest_B)
\end{equation}

As we assume $U_S(G) > 0$, this strategy yields a bigger payout than the honest strategy (8.4, 8.7):
\[P_S(dishonestSeller,Post\_Tx\_honest_B) = P_S(honest_S,honest_B) + U_S(G)\]

This contradicts our assumption that $G$ is a successful Game as defined in 4.2, as the honest strategy is no longer the best strategy for the Seller when the buyer is acting rational.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Seller deposits collateral $C_S > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer deposits collateral $C_B > P$ to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer sends funds of amount $P$ \orfnote{sends $P$ coins} to the Smart
    Contract \orfnote{this step could be combined with the previous one}
    \item Seller sends physical good $G$ to the seller and reports it to the Smart Contract
    \item Buyer receives the physical good and confirms \orfnote{reports} it to the Smart Contract
    \item The Smart Contract releases the collateral of the Seller and the Buyer and sends $P$ to the Seller
